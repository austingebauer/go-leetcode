# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Difficulty:

Medium

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is 
rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```
