# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

## Difficulty:

Medium

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:
```
    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

```
Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```
