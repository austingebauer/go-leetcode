# 7. Reverse Integer

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

# Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit 
signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your 
function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Example 1:
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

Example 2:
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```

Example 3:
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```
