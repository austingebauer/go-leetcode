# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

# Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated 
at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. 
If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
