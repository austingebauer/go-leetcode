# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

## Difficulty:

Medium

## Description

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

Note:
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), 
where n is the array's size.
