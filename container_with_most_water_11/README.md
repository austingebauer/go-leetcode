https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

# Description

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at 
coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line 
i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a 
container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. 
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
