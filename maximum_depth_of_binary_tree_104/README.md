https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

## Difficulty:

Easy

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest 
path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3

  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
