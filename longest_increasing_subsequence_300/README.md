# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

## Difficulty:

Medium

## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:
```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

Note:
- There may be more than one LIS combination, 
it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
- Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
