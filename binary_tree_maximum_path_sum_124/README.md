# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

## Difficulty:

Hard

## Description

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some 
starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. 

The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42
```
