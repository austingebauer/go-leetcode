# 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/

## Difficulty:

Medium

## Description

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, 
find whether it's possible to divide this array into k 
non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
Output: True
Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets 
(5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
```

Note:
- 1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.
- 0 < nums[i] < 10000.
